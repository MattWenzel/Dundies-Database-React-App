To install the required dependencies, navigate to both the `frontend` and `backend` folders and run:

```
npm install
```

## Usage

## Credits

The `db-connector.js` file and `db.pool.query` method used to connect to the database and send queries was adapted from the `osu-cs340-ecampus nodejs-starter-app`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/osu-cs340-ecampus/nodejs-starter-app).

React boilerplate files were generated using the commands/instructions found [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Deployment of the app to the OSU Flip Servers was done following the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/abkamand/cs340-react-test-app-v2/).

CSS Styling was done using Tailwind CSS.  Tailwind Documentation can be found [here](https://tailwindcss.com/).

All other code and logic for this app was created by Ahron Townsley and Matthew Wenzel.
